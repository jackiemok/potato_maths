\subsection*{Exercise 8}
We must find the irreducible factors of $f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6$ over $\mathbb{Q}, \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2}),$ and $\mathbb{R}$.

$f(x) = x^4 - 5x^2 + 6 \\
= (x^2 - 3)(x^2 - 2)$

All factors are irreducible over $\mathbb{Q}$. The last factor is reducible over $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{2})$, while both factors are reducible over $\mathbb{R}$ since $f(x) = (x + \sqrt{3})(x - \sqrt{3})(x + \sqrt{2})(x - \sqrt{2})$.
