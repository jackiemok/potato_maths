\subsection*{Exercise 24}
Let $F$ be a finite field. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there do not exist irreducible polynomials of arbitrarily high degree in $F[x]$. Then, we can write a finite list of irreducible polynomials $p_1,p_2,...,p_n$, with $p_n$ the polynomial of highest degree, say $m$.

Then, consider the polynomial $q = \prod_{i=1}^n p_i + 1$ in $F[x]$ with degree $\sum_{i=1}^n \textnormal{deg}(p_i)$. By Theorem 4.2.9, we can uniquely express $q$ as a product of monic irreducible polynomials and a constant in $F$. One of these monic irreducible polynomials, say $p$, must be in our list $p_1,p_2,...,p_n$. Then, $p \mid q \implies p \mid p_1p_2...p_n$ and $p \mid (q - \prod_{i=1}^n p_i) \implies p \mid 1$. But $1 \in F$ is of degree 0, and $p$ must have degree at least 1. $p$ cannot divide a lower-degree polynomial or constant. We have reached our required contradiction and conclude that $F[x]$ indeed has irreducible polynomials of arbitrarily high degree.
