\subsection*{Exercise 8}
\textit{Show that if $R$ is a finite ring, then every prime ideal of $R$ is maximal.}

\vspace{5 mm}
Suppose that $R$ is a finite ring and $I \subseteq R$ is a prime ideal of $R$. Then by Proposition 5.3.9, the factor ring $R/I$ is an integral domain. Furthermore, since $|R| < \infty$, then $|R/I| < \infty$ and $R/I$ is a field by Theorem 5.1.9. But the factor ring $R/I$ is a field if and only if $I$ is a maximal ideal of $R$.
