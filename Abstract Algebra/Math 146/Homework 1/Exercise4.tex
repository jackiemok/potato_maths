\subsection*{Exercise 6}
Suppose that $p$ is a prime number. Let $f(x) = (x^{p-1} - 1) \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$. To find the roots of $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$, we must find the values of $x$ which satisfy the congruence $(x^{p-1} - 1) \equiv 0$ (mod $p$), or equivalently $x^{p-1} \equiv 1$ (mod $p$). These are those elements $x \in \mathbb{Z}_p$ satisfying gcd($x^{p-1},p$) = 1, and thus gcd($x,p$) = 1. We know that there are $p-1$ such elements coprime to $p$, and therefore, these $p-1$ values must be the roots of $f(x)$ in $\mathbb{Z}_p$. The roots of $f(x) = (x^{p-1} - 1)$ are given by the elements of $\mathbb{Z}_p\backslash\{[0]_p\} = \{1,2,...,p-1\}$.
