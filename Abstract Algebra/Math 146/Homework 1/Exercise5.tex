\subsection*{Exercise 7}
Suppose that $c \in F$ and $k > 2$ is an odd integer. We want to show that $(x + c) \vert (x^k + c^k)$. That is, we must find some $q(x) \in F[x]$ such that $(x^k + c^k) = q(x)(x+c)$. Take $q(x) = (x^{k-1} - cx^{k-2} - ... - c^{k-2}x - c^{k-1})$. This satisfies the desired condition.
