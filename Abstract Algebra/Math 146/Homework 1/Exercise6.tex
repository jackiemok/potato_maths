\subsection*{Exercise 1(b)}
We must use the division algorithm to find the quotient and remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $g(x)$ over $\mathbb{Q}$. We are given that $f(x) = 2x^7 - 5x^6 + 5x^5 - x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 5$ and $g(x) = x^2 - x + 1$.

\polylongdiv{2x^7 - 5x^6 + 5x^5 - x^3 - x^2 + 4x - 5}{x^2 - x + 1}

Thus, the quotient is given by $q(x) = 2x^5 - 3x^4 + 3x^2 + 2x - 2$ and the remainder is given by $r(x) = -3$.
