\subsection*{Exercise 2(b)}
We must use the division algorithm again to find the quotient and remainder when $f(x)$ is divided by $g(x)$ over the field F = $\mathbb{Z}_5$. We are given that $f(x) = x^5 + 4x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2$ and $g(x) = x^2 + 3$.

\polylongdiv{x^5 + 4x^4 + 2x^3 + 3x^2}{x^2 + 3}

The quotient is given by $q(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 - x - 9$, or equivalently, $q(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + 4x + 1$ over $\mathbb{Z}_5$. Similarly, the remainder is given by $r(x) = 3x + 27$, or equivalently, $r(x) = 3x + 2$ over $\mathbb{Z}_5$.
