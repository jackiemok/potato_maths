\subsection*{Exercise 15}
Let $f(x) = (x^n - a) \in \mathbb{R}[x]$, with $a \ne 0$. We want to show that $f(x)$ has no multiple roots in $\mathbb{R}$. By Proposition 4.2.11, this is true if and only if gcd($f(x),f'(x)$) = 1.

But $f'(x) = nx^{n-1}$, and so gcd($x^n - a, nx^{n-1}$) = 1. Therefore, $f(x)$ has no repeated roots in $\mathbb{R}$.
