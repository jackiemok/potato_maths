\subsection*{Exercise 2}
Suppose that $p$ is a prime number and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. A polynomial $f(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_p[x]$ of degree $n$ is of the form $f(x) = a_nx^n + a_{n-1}x^{n-1} + ... + a_1x + a_0$, where $a_n \notin [0]_p$. Therefore, there are $|\mathbb{Z}_p \backslash \{[0]_p\}| = (p-1)$ choices for the value of coefficient $a_n$. On the other hand, we are free to choose whichever values we want for the remaining coefficients $a_i$ for $i \in \{0,1,...,n-1\}$. There are $p$ choices each for the remaining $n$ coefficients. Thus, the total number of polynomials of degree $n$ over $\mathbb{Z}_p$ is $(p-1)p^n$.
