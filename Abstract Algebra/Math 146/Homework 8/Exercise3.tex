\subsection*{Exercise 6}
\textit{Let F be the splitting field of a separable polynomial over K, and let E be a subfield between K and F. Show that if [E:K] = 2, then E is the splitting field of some polynomial over K.}

Suppose that $F$ is the splitting field of a separable polynomial over $K$. Let $E$ be a subfield between $K$ and $F$, such that $[E:K] = 2$. Now, let $H =$ Gal($F/E)$, a subgroup of $G =$ Gal($F/K)$.

Then, we have that $[F^H:K] = [E:K] = [G:H] = 2$, and so $H$ is normal in $G$. This implies that $E = F^H$ is a normal extension of $K$. $E$ is also finite and separable over $K$, and so $E$ is the splitting field of some polynomial over $K$.
