\subsection*{Exercise 2}
\textit{Let $F$ be a field and let $\phi: F \rightarrow R$ be a ring homomorphism. Show that $\phi$ is either zero or one-to-one.}

\vspace{5 mm}
Since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism between the field $F$ and the ring $R$, for each $a \in F$, we have $\phi(a) = b$ for some $b \in R$. If $F = \{ 0 \}$, then $\phi(0) = 0$ and $\phi$ is zero. Otherwise, $F \ne \{ 0\}$ and we have some $x$ and $x^{-1}$ in $F$. Then, by multiplicativity of $\phi$, we have that $\phi(x)\cdot\phi(x^{-1}) = \phi(x \cdot x^{-1}) = \phi(1) = 1.$ But then, $\phi(x) = 1 \implies x = e_F$ implies that $\phi$ is one-to-one, as required.
