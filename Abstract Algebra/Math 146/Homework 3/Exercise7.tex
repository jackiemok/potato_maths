\subsection*{Exercise 11}
\textit{Show that the direct sum of two nonzero rings is never an integral domain.}

\vspace{5 mm}
Let $R_1, R_2$ be two nonzero rings, and consider their direct sum $R := R_1 \oplus R_2$. There exist some nonzero $r \in R_1$ and $s \in R_2$ such that $(r,0), (0,s) \in R$. But $(r,0)\cdot(0,s) = (0,0)$, and so given any $a,b \in R$ with $ab = 0$, it is not true that either $a=0$ or $b=0$. Therefore, $R$ is not an integral domain.
