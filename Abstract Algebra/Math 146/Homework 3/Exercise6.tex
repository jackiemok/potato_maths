\subsection*{Exercise 3}
\textit{Let $F,E$ be fields, and let $\phi: F \rightarrow E$ be a ring homomorphism. Show that if $\phi$ is onto, then $\phi$ must be an isomorphism.}

\vspace{5 mm}
Suppose that $\phi$ is onto. Then, for all $y \in E$, $y = \phi(x)$ for some $x \in F$, and thus, $\phi(F) = E$. Since $\phi$ is a ring homomorphism, it remains for us to verify that $\phi$ is one-to-one. $E$ is a field and certainly a ring, so by the previous exercise, $\phi$ is either zero or one-to-one. If $\phi$ is zero, then $F = \{0\}$ and $\phi(F) = E = \{0\}$. Therefore, $\phi$ is one-to-one and onto if $\phi$ is zero. On the other hand, if $F \ne \{0\}$, then $\phi$ is one-to-one and onto as well.
