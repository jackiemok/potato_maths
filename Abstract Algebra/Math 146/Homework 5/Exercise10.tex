\subsection*{Exercise 7}
\textit{Let $F \supseteq K$ be fields, and let R be a ring such that $F \supseteq R \supseteq K.$ If F is an algebraic extension of K, show that R is a field. What happens if we do not assume that F is algebraic over K?}

\vspace{5 mm}
Let R be a ring such that $F \supseteq R \supseteq K$, where $F$ and $K$ are both fields. If $F$ is an algebraic extension of $K$, then each element of $F$ is algebraic over $K$. By Corollary 6.2.8, the set of all elements of $F$ which are algebraic over $K$ forms a subfield of $F$. Thus, the ring $R$ contains some or all of the algebraic elements over $K$, as a subset of $F$. But since $R \subseteq F$ and $F$ is a field, $R$ must also be a field.

On the other hand, if we do not assume that $F$ is algebraic over $K$, we cannot guarantee that $R$ contains enough algebraic elements over $K$ to form a subfield of $F$.
