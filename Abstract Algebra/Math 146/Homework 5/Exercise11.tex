\subsection*{Exercise 11}
\textit{Let F be an algebraic extension of K, and let S be a subset of F such that $S \supseteq K$, S is a vector space over K, and $s^n \in S$ for all $s \in S$ and all positive integers n. Prove that if char(K) $\not= 2$, then S is a subfield of F.}

\textit{(The result is false in characteristic 2, and all of the tools necessary to construct a counterexample are at hand, but the counterexample is not an easy one.}

Suppose that $K \subseteq S \subseteq F$, where $S$ is a vector space over $K$ with $s^n \in S$ for all $s \in S$ and $n \in \mathbb{Z}^+$. Since $F$ is an algebraic extension of $K$, by Exercise 6.2.7, $S$ is a field and thus an integral domain. By Proposition 5.2.11, char($S$) = 0 or $p$, for some prime number $p$. Since $K \subseteq S \subseteq F$, where $S$ and $F$ are fields, char($K$) = char($S$) = char($F) \not= 2$.

Moreover, the set of all elements of $F$ that are algebraic over $K$ forms a subfield of $F$. But since $F$ is algebraic over $K$, each element of $F$ is algebraic over $K$.
