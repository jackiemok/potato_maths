\subsection*{Exercise 7}
\textit{Let F = K(u), where u is transcendental over the field K. If E is a field such that $K \subset E \subseteq F$, then show that u is algebraic over E.}

\vspace{5 mm}
Since $F = K(u)$ is a simple extension of $K$, with $u \in F$ transcendental over $K$, by Proposition 6.1.5, $F = K(u) \cong K(x) = Q(K[x])$, the quotient field of the integral domain $K[x]$. Thus, any subfield $E$ containing both $K$ and $u$ must be equal to $K(u)$, and $u$ is algebraic over $E$.
