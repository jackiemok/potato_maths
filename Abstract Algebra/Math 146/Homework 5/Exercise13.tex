\subsection*{Exercise 3(c)}
\textit{Determine the splitting fields over $\mathbb{Z}_2$ for the following polynomials.}

\textit{(c) $x^3 + x + 1$}

\vspace{5 mm}
The polynomial $f(x) = x^3 + x + 1$ of degree 3 has no roots in $\mathbb{Z}_2$, so it is irreducible in $\mathbb{Z}_2[x]$. Then, $\mathbb{Z}_2[x]/\langle f(x) \rangle$ is a field with $x^3 + x + 1 = (x - u)g(x)$ for some root $u$ in our desired splitting field and some polynomial $g(x) \in \mathbb{Z}_2[x]/\langle f(x) \rangle$ of degree 2. Then, $x^3 + x + 1 = (x - u)(x^2 + ux + (1+u^2))$. Then, the splitting field for $f(x) = x^3 + x + 1$ is $\mathbb{Z}_2(u)$, where $u = x + \langle x^3 + x + 1 \rangle$.
