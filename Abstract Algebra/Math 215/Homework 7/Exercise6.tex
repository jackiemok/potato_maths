\subsection*{Exercise 8}
Let $\phi: M \rightarrow N$ be an $R$-module homomorphism. We want to show that $\phi($Tor($M)) \subseteq$ Tor($N)$. Since $\phi$ is a homomorphism, we require that $\phi(0_M) = 0_N$ and $\phi(rx) = r\phi(x)$, for every $r \in R$ and $x \in M$. Moreover, for any $m \in$ Tor($M)$, there exists some $r \not= 0 \in R$ such that $rm = 0$. But this implies that $0_N = \phi(0_M) = \phi(rm) = r\phi(m)$, where $\phi(m) \in N$ and $r \not= 0 \in R$. That is, $\phi(m) \in$ Tor($N)$, so we have shown $\phi($Tor($M)) \subseteq$ Tor($N)$, as required.
