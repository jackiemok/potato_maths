\subsection*{Exercise 5}
We want to show that $A_n$ is the commutator subgroup for $S_n$, for each $n \ge 5$. Since $A_n \triangleleft S_n$ and $|S_n/A_n| = 2$, for each $n \ge 5$, $S_n/A_n$ is abelian. Then, by Proposition 7, $S_n' \le A_n$ since $S_n/S_n'$ is the largest abelian quotient of $S_n$. Note also that $A_n$ is simple, for each $n \ge 5$, and $S_n' \not= 1$ since $S_n$ is not abelian. Moreover, by Exercise 4.4.8 and Proposition 7, since $S_n'$ char $S_n$ and thus, $S_n'$ char $A_n \triangleleft S_n$, it follows that $S_n' \triangleleft S_n$. Therefore, $S_n' \trianglelefteq A_n$ and thus, $S_n' = A_n$, for all $n \ge 5$.
