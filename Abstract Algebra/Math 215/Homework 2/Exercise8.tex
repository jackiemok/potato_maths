\subsection*{Exercise 10}
Let $G$ be a non-abelian group of order $6 = 2^1\cdot3 = 3^1\cdot2$. By Sylow's Theorem, we can find subgroups $H,K \le G$ of orders 2 and 3, respectively. We claim that $H$ is not normal in $G$, but suppose for the sake of contradiction that $H \trianglelefteq G$. Then, $G/K$ and $G/H$ have indices $|G:H| = |G|/|H| = 6/2 = 3$ and $|G:K| = |G|/|K| = 6/3 = 2$, so $K$ is normal in $G$ as well. But then, we can consider the product group $HK \le G$, which must be $G$, since $|HK| = |H|\cdot|K|/|H\cap K| = (2\cdot 3)/|\{e\}| = 6$, since (2,3) = 1. But $H \cong \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $K \cong \mathbb{Z}_3 \implies HK = G \cong \mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_3 \cong \mathbb{Z}_6$, which is cyclic and abelian. This contradicts our choice of $G$ being non-abelian. Therefore, $H$ cannot be normal in $G$.

Now, this implies that if $H$ were normal, then $G$ would be abelian and isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_6$. Otherwise, $G$ is non-abelian and therefore isomorphic to $S_3$ by Cayley's Theorem. To see this, notice that $S_3 = \langle (1,2), (1,2,3) \rangle$. Let $H = \langle (1,2) \rangle$ and $K = \langle (1,2,3) \rangle$ with orders 2 and 3, respectively, where $K \trianglelefteq S_3$, but $H \not\trianglelefteq S_3$. This describes an appropriate isomorphism between our group $G$ and $S_3$.
