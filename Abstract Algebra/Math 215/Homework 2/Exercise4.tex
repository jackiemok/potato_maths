\subsection*{Exercise 10}
Given a group $G$, let $H = N_{r-1} \cap M_{s-1}$. We proceed by induction on min$\{r,s\}$ to show that the composition factors in the composition series for $G$ are unique. In the case where min$\{r,s\} = 1$, the property certainly holds since $1 = N_0 \trianglelefteq N_1 \trianglelefteq N_2 \trianglelefteq ... \trianglelefteq N_r = G$ and $1 = M_0 \trianglelefteq M_1 = G$ implies that $G = G/\{e\}$ is simple, thereby forcing $r = 1$. In the case where min$\{r,s\} = 2$, we have the result from the previous exercise. So suppose that the result holds for some $n \in \mathbb{N}$.

In the case where min$\{r,s\} = (n+1)$, we may assume without loss of generality that $1 = N_0 \trianglelefteq N_1 \trianglelefteq N_2 \trianglelefteq ... \trianglelefteq N_r = G$ and $1 = M_0 \trianglelefteq M_1 \trianglelefteq M_2 \trianglelefteq ... \trianglelefteq M_{s=(n+1)} = G$. Furthermore, $1 = H_0 \trianglelefteq H_1 \trianglelefteq H_2 \trianglelefteq ... \trianglelefteq H_s$, where $H_j = N_i \cap M_j$, for all $0 \le i,j, \le (s-1)=n$. By the same reasoning as in the previous exercise, we deduce that $N_{r-1}$ and $M_{n = (s-1)}$ are the largest normal subgroups contained in $G$ such that $G/N_{r-1}$ and $G/M_n$ are simple. Furthermore, since both $N_{r-1}$ and $M_n$ are normal in $G$, we can consider the product subgroup $N_{r-1}M_n$ with intersection $H_n$. $H_n$ must be $\{e\}$, as in the previous exercise.

Following the same procedure as in the previous exercise, we obtain by the Second Isomorphism Theorem: $N_{r-1}M_n/N_{r-1} \cong G/N_{r-1} \cong M_n/H_n \implies M_n/H_n$ is simple. This implies that $N_r/N_{r-1} \cong M_n/H_n$. 

Now, by following the same procedure with $M_nN_{r-1}/M_n \cong N_{r-1}/H_n$, we obtain $G/M_n \cong N_{r-1}/H_n \implies M_s/M_n \cong N_{r-1}/H_n$. Therefore, $r = s$, and $M_i = N_j,$ for all $0 \le i,j \le s$.
