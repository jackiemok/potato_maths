\subsection*{Exercise 11}
We claim that $S_4$ has no subgroup isomorphic to $Q_8$. $Q_8 = \{\pm1, \pm i, \pm j, \pm k\} = \langle -1, i,j,k \mid o(-1) = 2$ and $o(x) = 4$, for $x = \pm i, \pm j, \pm k, ijk \rangle$ and $S_4 = \langle (12), (1234) \rangle$. If there were an isomorphism $\phi: S_4 \rightarrow Q_8$, then it would send $\langle(1,2)\rangle$ to $\langle-1\rangle \le Q_8$ and all four-cycles or elements of order 4 to $\{\pm x \mid x = i,j,k\} \subset Q_8$. But, $H := \{x \in S_4 \mid o(x) = 4\} = \{(1234),(1243),(1324),(1342),(1423),(1432)\}$, whose elements' squares are not all equal, so $\phi$ could not be multiplicative. For example, $(1234)^2 = (13)(24) \not= (14)(23) = (1243)^2$, but in $Q_8$, $\pm x^2 = -1$, for $x = i,j,k$. Therefore, $S_4$ cannot contain a subgroup isomorphic to $Q_8$.
