\subsection*{2.} Suppose that $G$ is a group of order $462 = 2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7 \cdot 11$. We claim that $G$ is not simple. By Sylow's Theorem, $Syl_{11}(G) \not= \emptyset$ since $11 \nmid m$, where $m = (2 \cdot 3 \cdot 7) = 42$ and $11m = |G| = 462$. Furthermore, the number of Sylow $11$-subgroups of $G$ is given by $n_{11} \equiv 1$ (mod 11), such that $n_{11} \mid m$. Then, we require that $n_{11} = 1$ since $a \not\equiv 1$ (mod 11), for any $a \in \{2,3,7,(2\cdot3)=6, (2\cdot7)=14, (3\cdot7)=21, (2\cdot3\cdot7)=m\}$. Then, $P \in Syl_{11}(G)$ is the unique Sylow 11-subgroup of $G$. It now follows by Corollary 4.5.20 that $P \triangleleft G$, so that $G$ is not simple, as desired.
