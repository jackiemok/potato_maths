\subsection*{Exercise 32}
Let $\phi: R \rightarrow S$ be a homomorphism of rings. Suppose that $x \in R$ is nilpotent. We claim that $\phi(x) \in S$ is nilpotent as well. By assumption, there exists some $m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $x^m = 0 \in R$. Then, since $\phi$ is multiplicative, $\phi(x)^m = \phi(x^m) = \phi(0) = 0$, which implies that $\phi(x)$ is nilpotent in $S$, our desired result.
