\subsection*{Exercise 30}
Suppose that $R$ is a commutative ring and $\mathfrak{N}(R)$ is its nilradical. We want to show that zero is the only nilpotent element of $R/\mathfrak{N}(R)$ so that $\mathfrak{N}(R/\mathfrak{N}(R)) = \{0\}$. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there exists some $(a + \mathfrak{N}(R)) \not= (0 + \mathfrak{N}(R)) \in R/\mathfrak{N}(R)$ that is nilpotent, where $a \not\in \mathfrak{N}(R)$. Then, there exists some $m \in \mathbb{Z}^+$ such that $(a + \mathfrak{N}(R))^m = (0 + \mathfrak{N}(R)) \in R/\mathfrak{N}(R)$. But by Proposition 6, $(a + \mathfrak{N}(R))^m = (a^m + \mathfrak{N}(R)) = (0 + \mathfrak{N}(R))$, which implies that $a \in \mathfrak{N}(R)$, contradicting our choice of $a$. Therefore, zero is the only nilpotent element of $R/\mathfrak{N}(R)$.
