\subsection*{Exercise 17}
Let $G$ be a group. We want to show that the map $\phi: G \rightarrow G$ defin(ed by $\phi(g) = g^{-1}$ is a homomorphism if and only if $G$ is abelian. Suppose first that $G$ is abelian, so that $\forall x,y \in G, xy = yx$. Then, $\phi(e) = e^{-1} = e$ and $\phi(yx) = \phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y) = x^{-1}y^{-1} = (yx)^{-1}$. $\phi$ is therefore a homomorphism.

Now, suppose that $\phi$ defines a homomorphism. Then, $\forall x,y \in G, y^{-1}x^{-1} = (xy)^{-1} = \phi(xy) = \phi(x)\phi(y) = x^{-1}y^{-1}$, which shows that $G$ is abelian.
