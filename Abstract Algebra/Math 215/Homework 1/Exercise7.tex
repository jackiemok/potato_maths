\subsection*{Exercise 12}
For $n \in 2\mathbb{Z}^+$, we want to show that $D_{2n} = \langle r,s \mid s^2 = r^n = e, rs = sr^{-1} \rangle$ acts on the set of pairs of opposite vertices of a regular $n-$gon $V = \{(x,[x + n/2]_n) \mid x = 1,..., n\}$. Then, for $r,s \in D_{2n}$ and $(x,[x+n/2]_n) \in V$ and $m \in \mathbb{Z}$, $r^m(x,[x+n/2]_n) = ([x+m]_n, [x+n/2+m]_n)$ and $s(x,[x+n/2]_n) = ([(n+2)-x]_n,[(n+2)-(x+n/2)]_n)$. Now, we have $r^js^kx = r^j(s^kx)$ as a composition of functions. The kernel of this group action is the set of permutations that send $(x,y)$ to $(x,y)$ or $(y,x)$, for any $x,y = 1,...,n$. There are only two such elements of $D_{2n}$ which describe these actions, namely $e_{D_{2n}}$ and $r^{n/2}$, for $n \ge 6$. Note that, in the case where $n = 4$, there are 4 such elements in the kernel, namely, $e_{D_8}, r^2, r^2s, s$.
