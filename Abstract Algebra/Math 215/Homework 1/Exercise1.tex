\subsection*{Exercise 6}
We claim that the squares of the elements of $\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z} = \{[0],[1],[2],[3]\}$ are either $[0]$ or $[1]$. 
\begin{align*}
    [0]^2 &= [0]\cdot[0] = [0] \\
    [1]^2 &= [1]\cdot[1] = [1] \\
    [2]^2 &= [2]\cdot[2] = [4] = [0] \\
    [3]^2 &= [3]\cdot[3] = [9] = [1]
\end{align*}
 Therefore, for any $a \in \mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}$, we have that $a^2 \in \{[0],[1]\}$, as desired.
