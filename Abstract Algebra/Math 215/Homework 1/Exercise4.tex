\subsection*{Exercise 25}
Suppose that $x^2 = e, \forall x \in G$. We claim that $G$ is necessarily abelian. Then, $|x| \in \{1,2\}, \forall x \in G$, and $x^2 = x\cdot x = e \implies x = x^{-1}, \forall x \in G$. Now, for any $x, y \in G$, we have that $xy = (xy)^{-1} = y^{-1}x^{-1} = yx$, which shows that $G$ is abelian.
