\subsection*{Exercise 15}
Let $H_1 \le H_2 \le ...$ be an ascending chain of subgroups of $G$. Then, clearly $e_G \in \cup_{i=1}^\infty H_i \not= \emptyset$. Furthermore, for any $x,y \in \cup_{i=1}^\infty H_i, xy^{-1}$ is in at least one of the $H_i$ and thus is in $\cup_{i=1}^\infty H_i$, so that $\cup_{i=1}^\infty H_i$ is closed under multiplication. Therefore, $\cup_{i=1}^\infty H_i$ is a subgroup of $G$.
