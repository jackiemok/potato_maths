\subsection*{Exercise 18}
Let $H$ be a group acting on a set $A$. Let $\sim$ be the relation on $A$ defined by $a \sim b$ if and only if $a = hb$, for some $h \in H$. We want to show that $\sim$ is an equivalence relation. Let $a,b,c \in A$. Then, $\sim$ is reflexive: $a \sim a \iff a = ha$, with $h = e \in H$ since $H$ is a group. $\sim$ is symmetric: $a \sim b \iff a = hb$, for some $h \in H$. But this implies that $b = h^{-1}a \implies b \sim a$, since $H$ is closed under taking inverses. Finally, $\sim$ is transitive: $a \sim b$ and $b \sim c \implies a = h_1b$ and $b = h_2c$, for some $h_1,h_2 \in H$. Substituting, we obtain $a = h_1(h_2c) = (h_1h_2)c$, where $h_1h_2 \in H$ since $H$ is a group. This shows that $a \sim c$, as required.
