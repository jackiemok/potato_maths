\subsection*{Exercise 12}
We verify that the following groups are not cyclic:

\textbf{[a]} $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ has order 4, and so if it were cyclic should be isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}_4$. But every element other than the identity $([0],[0])$ has order 2 in $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$, whereas in $\mathbb{Z}_4$, only $[2]_4$ has order 2. Therefore, $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ is not cyclic.

\textbf{[b]} If $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$ were cyclic, then $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z} = \langle ([1]_2, 1) \rangle$ or $\langle ([1]_2, -1) \rangle$. But $([x]_2,\pm1)^n = ([nx]_2,\pm n)$ does not generate all of $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}$.

\textbf{[c]} Similarly, if $\mathbb{Z} \times \mathbb{Z}$ were cyclic, then it would be generated by $(x,y)$, with $x,y = \pm 1$. But $(\pm1, \pm1)^n = (\pm n, \pm n)$, which do not generate all of $\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}$.
