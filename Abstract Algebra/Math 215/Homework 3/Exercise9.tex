\subsection*{Exercise 26}
Let $G$ be a group of order $105 = 3\cdot5\cdot7$. Suppose that $H \in Syl_3(G)$ is normal in $G$. We claim that $G$ is abelian. Since $H \in Syl_3(G)$ and $H \trianglelefteq G$, by Corollary 20, $n_3 = 1$ and $H$ char $G$. Furthermore, $N_G(H) = G$ and by Corollary 15, $G/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut($H)$. By Proposition 17, $|$Aut($H)| = 2$, so $|G:C_G(H)| = |G|/|C_G(H)| = 105/|C_G(H)| \in \{1,2\}.$ Since 2 does not divide $|G| = 105$, we require $|G:C_G(H)| = 1 \implies |C_G(H)| = |G| = 105$, so $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic and thus, $G$ is abelian.
