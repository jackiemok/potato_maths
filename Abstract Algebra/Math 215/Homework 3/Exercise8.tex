\subsection*{Exercise 25}
Suppose that $G$ is a group of order $385 = 5\cdot7\cdot11$. By Theorem 18, $n_{p} \equiv 1$ mod($p$) and $n_{p} \mid \prod_{p'\not=p}p'$, for $p = 5,7,11$. Following these constraints, we obtain $n_7 = 1$ and $n_{11} = 1$. By Corollary 20, $H \in Syl_7(G)$ is the unique Sylow 7-subgroup of $G$, where $H \trianglelefteq G$. Similarly, $K \in Syl_{11}(G)$ is the unique Sylow 11-subgroup of $G$, where $K \trianglelefteq G$. Now, since $H \trianglelefteq G$, $N_G(H) = G$ and by Corollary 15, $G/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut($H)$. By Proposition 17, $|$Aut($H)| = 6$, so $|G:C_G(H)| = |G|/|C_G(H)| = 385/|C_G(H)| \in \{1,2,3,6\}.$ Since neither of 2,3, or 6 divide $|G|$, we require $|G:C_G(H)| = 1 \implies |C_G(H)| = |G| = 385$. Then, every element of $G$ commutes with elements of $H$, which implies that $H \le Z(G)$. Therefore, $Z(G)$ contains the Sylow 7-subgroup.
