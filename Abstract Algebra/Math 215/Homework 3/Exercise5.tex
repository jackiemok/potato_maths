\subsection*{Exercise 13}
Let $G$ be a group of order $203 = 7 \cdot 29$, with $H \trianglelefteq G$ of order 7. We claim that $H \le Z(G)$ and $G$ is abelian. By Corollary 15, $N_G(H)/C_G(H) = G/C_G(H)$ is isomorphic to a subgroup of Aut($H$). Since $|H| = 7$ of odd prime order, Aut($H) = 6$ by Proposition 17. By Lagrange's Theorem, $|G/C_G(H)| \in \{1,2,3,6\}$. But since $H$ is cyclic, it is abelian and so, $H \le C_G(H)$. It now follows from Lagrange's Theorem that $|H| = 7$ divides $|C_G(H)|$, which forces $|G/C_G(H)| = 1$. Therefore, $C_G(H) = G$ and so, $H \le Z(G) \le C_G(H)$. Now since $G/Z(G)$ is cyclic, $G$ must be an abelian group.
