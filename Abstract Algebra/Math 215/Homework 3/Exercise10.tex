\subsection*{Exercise 33}
Let $P$ be a normal Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$ and let $H \le G$. We want to show that $K = P \cap H$ is the unique Sylow $p$-subgroup of $H$. Since $P \trianglelefteq G$, $n_p = 1$ and $P$ char $G$ by Corollary 20. Then, $|K| = |H \cap P| \le |P| = p^\alpha$, for some $\alpha \ge 0$. But $|K|$ cannot be $p^\beta$, for some $\beta < \alpha$, or else $n_p \not= 1$. Therefore, we require that $\alpha = \beta$ so that $|K| = |P| \implies K = P$.
