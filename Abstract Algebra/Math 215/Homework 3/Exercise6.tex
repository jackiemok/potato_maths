\subsection*{Exercise 5}
Suppose that $H \le D_{2n}$ is a Sylow $p$-subgroup, where $p$ is an odd prime. We claim that $H$ is cyclic and normal. Since $|D_{2n}| = \prod_{j=1}^k p_j^{\alpha_j} = 2n$, for some $k \in \mathbb{N}$, let $|H| = p^{\alpha}$, for some odd prime $p \in \{p_1,...,p_k\} \setminus \{2\}$ and $\alpha \ge 0$. Then, $p$ must divide $n$, which corresponds to $H$ being a subgroup of the normal cyclic group $\langle r \rangle \le D_{2n}$ of order $n$. All other subgroups of $D_{2n}$ have order 2, so we are justified in choosing a subgroup of $\langle r \rangle$. $H \le \langle r \rangle$ of order $p^\alpha$ exists and is normal, since $\langle r \rangle$ is cyclic and by Theorem 2.3.7. Now, by Exercise 4.4.9, $H$ must be cyclic and normal in both $\langle r \rangle$ and $D_{2n}$.
