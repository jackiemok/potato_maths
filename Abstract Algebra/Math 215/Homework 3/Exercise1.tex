\subsection*{Exercise 26}
Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group on the finite set $A$ with $|A| > 1$. Then there is only one orbit for its group action $\pi$ on $A$, so for any $a \in A$, the number of conjugates of $\{a\}$ is $|\mathcal{C}_a| = |G|$.

We want to show that there is some fixed point free element of $G$. By Proposition 2, for any $a \in A$, we must have $|G:G_{\{a\}}| = |\mathcal{C}_a| = |G|$, where $|G:G_{\{a\}}| = |G|/|G_{\{a\}}|$ forces $|G_{\{a\}}| = 1$. Therefore, for any $a \in A$, the stabilizer $G_{\{a\}}$ is trivial, so there is some fixed point free element of $G$.
