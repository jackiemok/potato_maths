\subsection*{Exercise 12}
\begin{framed}
\textit{Suppose the degree of the extension $K/F$ is a prime $p$. Show that any subfield $E$ of $K$ containing $F$ is either $K$ or $F$.}
\end{framed}

By Corollary 13, since $[K:F] = p < \infty$, $K/F$ is algebraic and finitely generated, so every element is a root of some nonzero polynomial $f(x) \in F[x]$. Let $E$ be a subfield of $K$ containing $F$, so that $F \subseteq E \subseteq K$. By Theorem 13.2.14, we have $[K:F] = [K:E][E:F]$, which implies that $[K:E]$ and $[E:F]$ divide $[K:F] = p$. Thus, $[E:F] = 1$ and $[K:E] = p$, or $[E:F] = p$ and $[K:E] = 1$. $K$ is finitely generated, so by Proposition 13.2.11, these statements are equivalently, $E = F$ and $E = K$, respectively.
